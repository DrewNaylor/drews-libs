This release is just as a base for the NuGet package. .NET Framework 4.6.1 and 4.8 packages are available below, but the NuGet package is only 4.8 for simplicity.

To use this library, please refer to the [getting started guide](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/drews-libs/blob/master/docs/libscrollswitchtabs-how-to-use.md), which is also available in the zip file.
