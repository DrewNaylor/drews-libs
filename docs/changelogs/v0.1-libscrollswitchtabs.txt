This release is just as a base for the NuGet package. Both the version below and the one in NuGet (whenever I get around to it) use .NET Framework 4.6.1.

To use this library, please refer to the [getting started guide](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/drews-libs/blob/master/docs/libscrollswitchtabs-how-to-use.md), which is also available in the zip file.
