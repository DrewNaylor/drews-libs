Please be sure to read the getting started guide available in "docs/getting-started.html".

If you have any trouble, you might be able to find an answer in the getting started guide described above and linked at the end of this readme file.

You can use Windows PowerShell to confirm the library's hash by running
"Get-FileHash .\libscrollswitchtabs.dll -Algorithm SHA256" in the folder you extracted the archive to and comparing the output to my sum listed below. HowToGeek has a nice article on this:
https://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/ , but the Windows section is a bit further down on the page.

7-Zip also has a way to check file hashes in the "CRC SHA" dropdown in the file context menu. This project is not associated with 7-Zip.

SHA-256 sum for "libscrollswitchtabs.dll" in the archive:
