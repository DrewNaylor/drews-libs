You can use Windows PowerShell to confirm the library's hash by running
"Get-FileHash .\libscrollswitchtabs.dll -Algorithm SHA256" in the folder you extracted the archive to and comparing the output to my sum listed below. HowToGeek has a nice article on this:
https://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/ , but the Windows section is a bit further down on the page.

7-Zip also has a way to check file hashes in the "CRC SHA" dropdown in the file context menu. This project is not associated with 7-Zip.
